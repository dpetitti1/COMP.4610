Write up:
-The scrabble game lays out 7 random letters from a data structure to their rack
-Includes a reset button that essentially resets the game and randomizes the 7 letters the user starts from
-The user is then able to drag and drop these letters into a specific location -- the scrabble board
-The board includes "double word score" and "double letter score" options which are calculated correctly based on the tile value
-Score is kept above the playboard and tells the user the word they are placing, current score, and remaining tiles left
